# Basic JavaScript

"*Data* is anything that is meaningful to the computer".

Eight JS Data Types

1. `undefined`
2. `null`
3. `boolean`
4. `string`
5. `symbol`
6. `bigint`
7. `number`
8. `object`

The *remainder operator* `%` is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus
operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with
negative numbers.

`String` values are *immutable*. 

Example:

```javascript

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";

// produces an error
```

Basic array methods:

* `push() // add as last element`
* `pop() // pop off last element`
* `shift() // pop off first element` 
* `unshift() // add as first element`

In Computer Science a *queue* is an abstract Data Structure where items are
kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items
are taken off from the front of the queue.

*type coercion* - in order for JS to compare to different data types, it must
convert one type to another.

Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==).
However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values
being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform
a type conversion.

*radix* - an integer between 2 and 36 that specifies the base of the number in the string.
