  // Redux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of 
  // different web technologies, including React.
  //
  // In Redux, there is a single state object that's responsible for the entire 
  // state of your application. This means if you had a React app with ten 
  // components, and each component had its own local state, the entire state of 
  // your app would be defined by a single state object housed in the Redux store. 
  // This is the first important principle to understand when learning Redux: the 
  // Redux store is the single source of truth when it comes to application state.
  //
  // This also means that any time any piece of your app wants to update state, 
  // it must do so through the Redux store. The unidirectional data flow makes it 
  // easier to track state management in your app.
  // ---
  // The Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state. There
  // is a method called createStore() on the Redux object, which you use to create
  // the Redux store. This method takes a reducer function as a required argument.
  // The reducer function is covered in a later challenge, and is already defined 
  // for you in the code editor. It simply takes state as an argument and 
  // returns state.
  //
  // Declare a store variable and assign it to the createStore() method, passing 
  // in the reducer as an argument.
  //
  // Note: The code in the editor uses ES6 default argument syntax to initialize 
  // this state to hold a value of 5. If you're not familiar with default 
  // arguments, you can refer to the ES6 section in the Curriculum which covers 
  // this topic.

  // then updates its state accordingly. Sometimes a Redux action also carries 
  // some data. For example, the action carries a username after a user logs in. 
  // While the data is optional, actions must carry a type property that specifies 
  // the 'type' of action that occurred.
  //
  // Think of Redux actions as messengers that deliver information about events 
  // happening in your app to the Redux store. The store then conducts the 
  // business of updating state based on the action that occurred.

  // When the state of your app begins to grow more complex, it may be tempting

  // Therefore, Redux provides reducer composition as a solution for a complex 
  // state model. You define multiple reducers to handle different pieces of 
  // your application's state, then compose these reducers together into one 
  // root reducer. The root reducer is then passed into the Redux createStore() 
  // method.
  //
  // In order to let us combine multiple reducers together, Redux provides the 
  // combineReducers() method. This method accepts an object as an argument in 
  // which you define properties which associate keys to specific reducer 
  // functions. The name you give to the keys will be used by Redux as the name 
  // for the associated piece of state.
  //
  // Typically, it is a good practice to create a reducer for each piece of 
  // application state when they are distinct or unique in some way. For example, 
  // in a note-taking app with user authentication, one reducer could handle 
  // authentication while another handles the text and notes that the user is 
  // submitting. For such an application, we might write the combineReducers() 
  // method like this:
  //
  // ```
  // const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({
  //   auth: authenticationReducer,
  //   notes: notesReducer

  // and handled by our notesReducer. This is how multiple reducers can be

  // argument. Within this function, you can dispatch actions and perform 
  // asynchronous requests.

  // In this example, an asynchronous request is simulated with a setTimeout()

  // asynchronous behavior so that your application state knows that some data 
  // is being requested (this state could display a loading icon, for instance).

  // simply pass the action directly to dispatch and the middleware takes care
