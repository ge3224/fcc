  // Redux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of 
  // different web technologies, including React.
  //
  // In Redux, there is a single state object that's responsible for the entire 
  // state of your application. This means if you had a React app with ten 
  // components, and each component had its own local state, the entire state of 
  // your app would be defined by a single state object housed in the Redux store. 
  // This is the first important principle to understand when learning Redux: the 
  // Redux store is the single source of truth when it comes to application state.
  //
  // This also means that any time any piece of your app wants to update state, 
  // it must do so through the Redux store. The unidirectional data flow makes it 
  // easier to track state management in your app.
  // ---
  // The Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state. There
  // is a method called createStore() on the Redux object, which you use to create
  // the Redux store. This method takes a reducer function as a required argument.
  // The reducer function is covered in a later challenge, and is already defined 
  // for you in the code editor. It simply takes state as an argument and 
  // returns state.
  //
  // Declare a store variable and assign it to the createStore() method, passing 
  // in the reducer as an argument.
  //
  // Note: The code in the editor uses ES6 default argument syntax to initialize 
  // this state to hold a value of 5. If you're not familiar with default 
  // arguments, you can refer to the ES6 section in the Curriculum which covers 
  // this topic.

  // An action is simply a JavaScript object that contains information about an 
  // action event that has occurred. The Redux store receives these action objects, 
  // then updates its state accordingly. Sometimes a Redux action also carries 
  // some data. For example, the action carries a username after a user logs in. 
  // While the data is optional, actions must carry a type property that specifies 
  // the 'type' of action that occurred.
  //
  // Think of Redux actions as messengers that deliver information about events 
  // happening in your app to the Redux store. The store then conducts the 
  // business of updating state based on the action that occurred.

  // property. Declare an object action and give it a property type set to the

function handleActionInStore() {
  // After an action is created and dispatched, the Redux store needs to know 
  // how to respond to that action. This is the job of a reducer function. 
  // Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take 
  // place in response to actions. A reducer takes state and action as arguments, 
  // and it always returns a new state. It is important to see that this is the 
  // only role of the reducer. It has no side effects — it never calls an API 
  // endpoint and it never has any hidden surprises. The reducer is simply a 
  // pure function that takes state and action, then returns new state.
  //
  // Another key principle in Redux is that state is read-only. In other words, 
  // the reducer function must always return a new copy of state and never modify 
  // state directly. Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, you are 
  // responsible for enforcing it in the code of your reducer functions. You'll 
  // practice this in later challenges.
  // ---
  // The code editor has the previous example as well as the start of a reducer 
  // function for you. Fill in the body of the reducer function so that if it 
  // receives an action of type 'LOGIN' it returns a state object with login set 
  // to true. Otherwise, it returns the current state. Note that the current state 
  // and the dispatched action are passed to the reducer, so you can access the 
  // action's type directly with action.type.
