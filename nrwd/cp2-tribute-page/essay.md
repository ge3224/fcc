Arriving in New York City in 1933, Noel Sickles was in his early twenties. He followed his fellow artist and friend, Milton Caniff. Back in Ohio, the two men had known each other for several years. They formed a studio  . Caniff was first to receive a job offer from the Associated Press; ... months later Sickles joined Caniff at AP.


Sickels was introduced to me in Steven D. Katz's well-known text on film directing, Shot by Shot. At the time, I was working as a staff artist in newsroom in Florida. I was looking for more ways of telling visual stories. I immediately wanted to know more about this illustrator who until reading, so I began searching the internet. I found two images of Sickles from this time period, wearing a suit and his Fedora. I felt like I might be able to adentitfy with him on a certain leverl, because at the time, I was working as a staff artist in a newsroom, bu tI wasn't a artoonists. Perhaps he reminded me of my grandfather in a way. I had received a drafting table that could be setup on a conventional desktop from my grandfather. So I imagined myself tapping into those legacy of staff artists, a lost breed who worked feverishly under tight deadlines while still managing to produce something innovative. I was more practical to sue the computer to do my work, but I complete a few of my projects with pen and ink.
