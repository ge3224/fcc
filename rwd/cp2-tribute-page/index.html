      <h1 id="title">Noel Sickles&mdash;Pioneer of Cinematic Illustration</h1>
      <p class="lede"><span class="caps">It started</span> with a ghost job, anonymous work on a comic strip to be
        completed daily, under a deadline, in the name and style of another artist.</p>
      <p class="lede">In 1933, the Associated Press Feature Service had a new hire, a twentysomething&mdash;Noel
        Sickles. He received
        the ghost assignment for <em>Scorchy Smith</em>. He would labor invisibly on this aviation adventure strip in
        place of its creator, John Terry.</p>
      <p class="lede">By springtime the following year, Sickles&rsquo; obscure role would lead to notoriety and a body
        of work that
        would forever change the world of illustrated art.</p>
      <p>Sickles was no rookie when he arrived in New York City that year. He was already an established cartoonist who
        left his native Ohio because of the Great Depression. His friend <a
          href="https://cartoons.osu.edu/digital_exhibits/miltoncaniff/" target="_blank">Milton Caniff</a> sent word
        about a job at AP. The two artists shared a studio in Ohio before work became scarce. Caniff left for AP the
        previous year.</p>
      <p>Not long after Sickles joined AP's staff, the need for a ghost artist arose when John Terry fell sick from
        tuberculosis. Terry, brother of <em>Terrytoons</em> co-founder <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Terry_(cartoonist)" target="_blank">Paul Terry</a>, created
        <em>Scorchy Smith</em> for AP in 1930. There was hope that Terry might recover and resume his work, but that
        hope was never realized. Terry died on February 27, 1934.
      </p>
      <p>Behind the scenes, Sickles kept <em>Scorchy Smith</em> in print for months while Terry convalesced. This
        continued even after Terry&rsquo;s death. But then, there came a change in Sickles&rsquo; assignment. He would
        no longer be a ghost artist.</p>
      <p>For the first time on April 2, 1934, the public saw Sickles&rsquo; signature printed on <em>Scorchy Smith</em>.
        They also began to witness new storytelling and drawing techniques. A new era for the strip had begun.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Sickles brought cinematic storytelling to Scorchy Smith,&rdquo; said Tom Mason, co-founder of <em><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu_Comics" target="_blank">Malibu Comics</a></em>. &ldquo;He varied
        angles, played around with light and shadow, and his characters look like they&rsquo;re moving instead of
        posing.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>According to Dean Mullaney, editor of <em>Scorchy Smith and the Art of Noel Sickles</em>, the changes he made
        in the serial had an excellent response from the public.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;When Sickles took over the strip, 100 newspapers subscribed to Scorchy Smith; after three years,
        circulation increased to more than 250 papers,&rdquo; Mullaney said in an <a
          href="http://www.gearlive.com/comics/article/q308-qa-dean-mullaney-on-noel-sickles-milton-caniff-and-eclipse-comics/"

      <p>For the next two-and-a-half years, Sickles produced his editions of <em>Scorchy Smith</em>, crafting a body of
        work that
        is now legendary. Other artists from various industries continue to study his work. His approach, dubbed
        chiaroscuro, can be found in works by generations of commercial artists.</p>
      <p>Steven Katz, author of <em>Film Directing: Shot By Shot&mdash;Visualizing from Concept to Screen</em>, wrote
        about
        Sickles, &ldquo;His work is filled with graphic solutions and innovations that are a storehouse of ideas for
        storyboard artists.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>On October 24, 1936, Noel Sickels resigned from Scorchy after AP rebuffed his request for salary renegotiation.
        There were other factors, according to Mullaney.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It should be pointed out, too, that Sickles was becoming bored with the constant deadlines of producing
        a
        daily strip,&rdquo; Mullaney said. &ldquo;He was such a perfectionist, he would often get to the last panel,
        decide he
        didn&rsquo;t like it, and throw out the entire strip, instead of doing a new third panel as a paste-over. He was
        also
        looking for new challenges.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Sickles went on to enjoy a successful career in magazine illustration and advertising. Artist Harry Devlin
        first met Sickles in 1940. In Devlin&rsquo;s <a
          href="https://societyillustrators.org/award-winners/noel-sickles/" target="_blank">biography of Sickles
          for the Society of Illustrators</a>, he describes Sickles&rsquo; success outside of cartooning.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Full recognition came to Noel following the war years,&rdquo; Devlin wrote. &ldquo;At one point the
        Saturday Evening Post
        offered him a carte blanche arrangement in which he could choose from any manuscript he might find appealing.
        Now his work appeared in all the major illustrated magazines and in many of the books published by
        Readers&rsquo;
        Digest.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Sickles remained prolific for the next four decades. When Sickles passed away in 1982, his panels for
        <em>Scorchy Smith</em> represented a fraction of a lifelong collection of inspiring works.
      </p>
      <p>Caniff wrote about his friend, &ldquo;This restless genius was the greatest natural cartoonist I ever knew. Now
        he is
        dead! All that talent still unused, and every cartoonist feels cheated of what might yet have come from his
        magic hand.&rdquo;</p>
