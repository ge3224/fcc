# Noel Sickles

It started with ghost work on a comic strip for the Associated Press Feature
Service in 1933, work to be completed daily, under deadline, in the name and
style of someone else.

A new hire, a twentysomething, would do the work—Noel Sickles. He would labor
invisibly. His assignment was for an aviation adventure strip called Scorchy
Smith.

In less than year, Sickles role would change. He would be widely known for his
work on Scorchy Smith, and he would forever change the world of illustrated
art.

Sickels arrived in New York City earlier that year when his friend Milt Caniff
sent word about a job. He joined Caniff at AP, leaving behind the economic
uncertainty he faced back in Ohio during the Great Depression.

The ghost assignment for Sickles arose when John Terry, another staff artist,
fell sick from tuberculosis. Terry created Scorchy Smith for AP in 1930. There
was hope of Terry recovering, but that hope went unfulfilled. Terry died
February 27, 1934.

Behind the scenes, Sickles kept Scorchy Smith in publication for months, even
after the loss of John Terry. But then, his role changed. He would no longer be
a ghost. 

On April 2, 1934, the public saw Sickles' signature printed in Scorchy Smith
for the first time. They also saw new storytelling and drawing techniques.

The innovations Sickles unveiled in Scorchy caught the attention of other
artists almost immediatly. His work also enjoyed an excellent reception from
the public. Scorchy Smith quickly became one of the most popular strips AP had
to offer, picked up by hundreds more of the syndicate's member newspapers.

"Sickles brought cinematic storytelling to Scorchy Smith," wrote Tom Mason,
co-founder of Malibu Comics. "He varied angles, played around with light and
shadow, and his characters look like they’re moving instead of posing." 

In fact, I first learned of Sickles in Steven Katz’s much-loved text on film
directing, Shot by Shot. In the book Katz wrote, “His work is filled with
graphic solutions and innovations that are a storehouse of ideas for storyboard
artists.”

Cartoonist Alexander Toth hailed Sickles in an interview for Comic Book Artist.
“What he did with figures and lighting and storytelling, the movie techniques
he brought into his strip!” exclaimed Toth. "Black-and-white photography, being
95 percent of movies in those days, excited him, and he adapted it into his
work on Scorchy Smith, using one graytone in his black-and-white art to
indicate patterns, light sources showing their effects, in snow scenes, night
scenes...remarkable stuff.”

Sickles’ produced all of his work for Scorchy Smith between 1933 and 1936. This
period represents a fraction of his body of work, which would span the next
four decades. 

His departure from AP was primarily the result of a disagreement over pay.
There was, however, another factor involved, according to Dean Mullaney, editor
of Scorchy Smith and the Art of Noel Sickles. 

In an online interview Mullaney said, “It should be pointed out, too, that
Sickles was becoming bored with the constant deadlines of producing a daily
strip. He was such a perfectionist, he would often get to the last panel,
decide he didn’t like it, and throw out the entire strip, instead of doing a
new third panel as a pasteover. He was also looking for new challenges.”

In the years to follow, Sickles’ art graced pages of the foremost illustrated
magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post, Reader’s Digest, Life, and
National Geographic. His work is found over a large cross-section of published
by the government and various advertising agencies.

Artist Harry Devlin in his biography of Sickles for the Society of Illustrators
wrote, “The quality of the work was superb. Never content with his output, Noel
destroyed many illustrations that would have elated art editors and left most
of his contemporaries thoroughly envious.”

When Sickles passed away in 1982, his lifelong friend Milton Caniff wrote,
“This restless genius was the greatest natural cartoonist I ever knew. Now he
is dead! All that talent still unused and every cartoonist feels cheated of
what might yet have come from his magic hand.”
