# Noel Sickles — Cartoonist, Illustrator, and Artist

The most widely known moments of Noel Sickles career began in 1933 when the twentysomething started doing ghost work on Scorchy Smith, an adventure comic strip created by John Terry for the Associated Press. 

Sickels had arrived in New York City just a few months before receiving the assignment for Scorchy. He moved from Ohio after receiving word about a job opening at AP from his friend Milton Caniff.

The need for ghost work subsequently arose when John Terry became gravely ill. He died early the following year. Sickles continued drawing Scorchy Smith under the name of the deceased until April 2, 1934. 

Then, Sickles began signing his work for the strip. Readers also started seeing a transformation in how the comic was written and drawn. His changes were well received. Scorchy Smith quickly became one of the most popular strips AP had to offer, picked up by hundreds more affiliate newspapers.

Biographers often describe Sickles’ art for Scorchy as impressionistic and cinematic.

In fact, I first learned of Sickles in Steven Katz’s much-loved text on film directing, Shot by Shot. In the book Katz wrote, “His work is filled with graphic solutions and innovations that are a storehouse of ideas for storyboard artists.”

Cartoonist Alexander Toth hailed Sickles in an interview for Comic Book Artist. “What he did with figures and lighting and storytelling, the movie techniques he brought into his strip!” exclaimed Toth. "Black-and-white photography, being 95 percent of movies in those days, excited him, and he adapted it into his work on Scorchy Smith, using one graytone in his black-and-white art to indicate patterns, light sources showing their effects, in snow scenes, night scenes...remarkable stuff.”

Sickles’ produced all of his work for Scorchy Smith between 1933 and 1936. This period represents a fraction of his body of work, which would span the next four decades. 

His departure from AP was primarily the result of a disagreement over pay. There was another factor involved, according to Dean Mullaney, editor of Scorchy Smith and the Art of Noel Sickles. 

In an online interview Mullaney said, “It should be pointed out, too, that Sickles was becoming bored with the constant deadlines of producing a daily strip. He was such a perfectionist, he would often get to the last panel, decide he didn’t like it, and throw out the entire strip, instead of doing a new third panel as a pasteover. He was also looking for new challenges.”

In the years to follow, Sickles’ art graced pages of the foremost illustrated magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post, Reader’s Digest, Life, and National Geographic. His work is found over a large cross-section of published by the government and various advertising agencies.

Artist Harry Devlin in his biography of Sickles for the Society of Illustrators wrote, “The quality of the work was superb. Never content with his output, Noel destroyed many illustrations that would have elated art editors and left most of his contemporaries thoroughly envious.”

When Sickles passed away in 1982, his lifelong friend Milton Caniff wrote, “This restless genius was the greatest natural cartoonist I ever knew. Now he is dead! All that talent still unused and every cartoonist feels cheated of what might yet have come from his magic hand.”
